Introduction
============

These are just some commands I use to manage and set up dev and test environments.
A lot of the code is borrowed from https://github.com/quafzi/magento-anonymizer .
Thanks quafzi!

OMFG DIRECT MYSLQ QUERY FAIL !!1!
---------------------------------

Aweseome that you take a look at the code before using it.
And yes, the MySQL queries are raw.
But I really don't want to trigger anything in magento in this case.
I just want to clear the data.
So I figured it's ok to use raw queries.
If you dissagree, pull requests are welcome.
